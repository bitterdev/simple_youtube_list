This add-on contains a block type that allows you to integrate all videos of a Youtube channel into your website.
 
The add-on is working with the latest YouTube Data API v3.

The configuration is very simple. Once you have created your Google API Key with access to the YouTube Data API you can add the included block type to your site and enter the api key as well as the channel id in the block type settings.

If you have to deal with a lot of videos the block type furthermore supports pagination.

Last but not least this add-on is fully translatable, easy to use and of course customizable by using Custom Templates.
